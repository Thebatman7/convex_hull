# convex_hull
The code implements a divide and conquer algorithm to efficiently find the convex hull of a set of points.
The repository contains a Graphical User Interface that generates a specified number of random points. The
software has been built so that no two points should have the same x value, though there could be
duplicate y values.
In the file convex_hull.py, you will find three parts of the compute_hull() method that you need to implement.
The code implements a divide and conquer algorithm (A divide-and-conquer algorithm is an algorithm design paradigm that
recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough 
to be solved directly) to efficiently find the convex hull of a set of points (The convex hull of a set of points is defined as the 
smallest convex polygon, that encloses all of the points in the set.).
